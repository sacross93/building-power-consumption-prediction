# Improved Preprocessing Report

## Applied Improvements

### 1. Target Variable Transformation
- Method: log1p
- Reduces right-skewness for better model training

### 2. Outlier Treatment
- 전력소비량(kWh): Clipped to [-3925.17, 8828.06]

### 3. Multicollinearity Removal
- Features selected: 62
- VIF threshold: 10.0

### 4. Feature Scaling
- Method: RobustScaler
- Robust to outliers, normalizes feature scales

### 5. Advanced Feature Engineering
- Cooling/Heating Degree Days
- Heat Index calculation
- Building efficiency scores
- Holiday indicators
- Building-type specific features

## Expected Benefits

1. **Better model convergence** from target transformation
2. **Reduced overfitting** from multicollinearity removal
3. **Improved gradient flow** from feature scaling
4. **Enhanced feature richness** from advanced engineering
5. **More robust predictions** from outlier handling
